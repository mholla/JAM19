# JAM19
code to reproduce results of Colin et al. JAM 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4042430)

The calculations (root and minima finding) and plotting are performed separately for efficiency (by JAM19.py and JAM19_plot.py, respectively). The output of both scripts are also included; figures are available here while the raw data is uploaded at Zenodo ([10.5281/zenodo.5550848](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5550848)) because they exceed Github's file size.
